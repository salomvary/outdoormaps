# Outdoor Maps for Mobile and Desktop

This project is a lightweight web based viewer for the best free online map
services.

Launch http://outdoormaps.eu.

The motivation behind the Outdoor Maps Project is to bring high quality maps to
any modern web browser (including mobile browsers). Unfortunately the
"official" web viewers for the providers are mostly hard to use, full of
unnecessary controls and don't work on mobile.
